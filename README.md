"Hello everyone! 
I'm excited to share my latest data visualization project - an interactive Netflix portfolio dashboard created using Tableau with you all. Special thanks to @DataScience RoadMap! 
You know how we all have that one streaming service we can't live without? For me, it's Netflix â€“ binging shows is pretty much my cardio these days. But this time, instead of just watching, I decided to dive deep into their content library.
I created an interactive dashboard that lets you explore the world of Netflix movies and TV shows like never before. Want to know which Top 10 genres are dominating the platform? Or how the content library has evolved over the years? This dashboard has all the juicy insights!
Building this project was a wild ride. From wrangling messy data to finding the perfect visualizations that tell a story, I had to flex all my data muscles. But the end result? Totally worth it!
I'm super proud of how it turned out, and I can't wait for you all to play around with it. Head over to my Tableau Public profile below and let me know what you think. I'm always eager to learn and grow, so hit me with your feedback and let's geek out together!"
